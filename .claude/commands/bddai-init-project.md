# Initialize a new BDD-AI Pair project

You are initializing a new BDD-AI Pair project.

Steps:
1. Check if already initialized (look for .bddai/config.json)
2. If not initialized:
   - Run: bddai init
   - Explain the created directory structure
   - Show the example PRD and feature files
3. Explain the workflow:
   - Add PRDs to requirements/
   - Run bddai requirements analyze
   - Review and approve features
   - Start pair programming with bddai pair start
4. Offer to help create their first PRD

Remember: BDD-AI Pair works best when you start with requirements, not code.
