# Run BDD tests and check implementation

You are running BDD tests to verify implementation.

Steps:
1. Run: bddai test
2. Review test results:
   - Which scenarios are passing?
   - Which are failing and why?
   - Are step definitions implemented?
3. If tests fail:
   - Read the scenario requirements
   - Check the implementation
   - Fix code to match scenario expectations
4. Report results to the user

Remember: Tests failing means implementation doesn't match the scenario requirements yet.
